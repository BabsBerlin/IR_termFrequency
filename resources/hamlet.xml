<LINE>He.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You come most carefully upon your hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am sick at heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you had quiet guard?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a mouse stirring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, good night.</LINE>
<LINE>If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,</LINE>
<LINE>The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Friends to this ground.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And liegemen to the Dane.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCISCO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bernardo has my place.</LINE>
<LINE>Give you good night.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Holla! Bernardo!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say,</LINE>
<LINE>What, is Horatio there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A piece of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have seen nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,</LINE>
<LINE>And will not let belief take hold of him</LINE>
<LINE>Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I have entreated him along</LINE>
<LINE>With us to watch the minutes of this night;</LINE>
<LINE>That if again this apparition come,</LINE>
<LINE>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit down awhile;</LINE>
<LINE>And let us once again assail your ears,</LINE>
<LINE>That are so fortified against our story</LINE>
<LINE>What we have two nights seen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sit we down,</LINE>
<LINE>And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Last night of all,</LINE>
<LINE>When yond same star that's westward from the pole</LINE>
<LINE>Had made his course to illume that part of heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</LINE>
<LINE>The bell then beating one,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Ghost</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In the same figure, like the king that's dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It would be spoke to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Question it, Horatio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with that fair and warlike form</LINE>
<LINE>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</LINE>
<LINE>Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is offended.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, it stalks away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Ghost</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis gone, and will not answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:</LINE>
<LINE>Is not this something more than fantasy?</LINE>
<LINE>What think you on't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before my God, I might not this believe</LINE>
<LINE>Without the sensible and true avouch</LINE>
<LINE>Of mine own eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it not like the king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As thou art to thyself:</LINE>
<LINE>Such was the very armour he had on</LINE>
<LINE>When he the ambitious Norway combated;</LINE>
<LINE>So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,</LINE>
<LINE>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis strange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</LINE>
<LINE>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In what particular thought to work I know not;</LINE>
<LINE>But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</LINE>
<LINE>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</LINE>
<LINE>Why this same strict and most observant watch</LINE>
<LINE>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</LINE>
<LINE>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</LINE>
<LINE>And foreign mart for implements of war;</LINE>
<LINE>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</LINE>
<LINE>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</LINE>
<LINE>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</LINE>
<LINE>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</LINE>
<LINE>Who is't that can inform me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That can I;</LINE>
<LINE>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</LINE>
<LINE>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,</LINE>
<LINE>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--</LINE>
<LINE>For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--</LINE>
<LINE>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,</LINE>
<LINE>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</LINE>
<LINE>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</LINE>
<LINE>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:</LINE>
<LINE>Against the which, a moiety competent</LINE>
<LINE>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd</LINE>
<LINE>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</LINE>
<LINE>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,</LINE>
<LINE>And carriage of the article design'd,</LINE>
<LINE>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</LINE>
<LINE>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</LINE>
<LINE>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,</LINE>
<LINE>For food and diet, to some enterprise</LINE>
<LINE>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--</LINE>
<LINE>As it doth well appear unto our state--</LINE>
<LINE>But to recover of us, by strong hand</LINE>
<LINE>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</LINE>
<LINE>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,</LINE>
<LINE>Is the main motive of our preparations,</LINE>
<LINE>The source of this our watch and the chief head</LINE>
<LINE>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it be no other but e'en so:</LINE>
<LINE>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</LINE>
<LINE>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king</LINE>
<LINE>That was and is the question of these wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.</LINE>
<LINE>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</LINE>
<LINE>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</LINE>
<LINE>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</LINE>
<LINE>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</LINE>
<LINE>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands</LINE>
<LINE>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</LINE>
<LINE>And even the like precurse of fierce events,</LINE>
<LINE>As harbingers preceding still the fates</LINE>
<LINE>And prologue to the omen coming on,</LINE>
<LINE>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</LINE>
<LINE>Unto our climatures and countrymen.--</LINE>
<LINE>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter Ghost</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to me:</LINE>
<LINE>If there be any good thing to be done,</LINE>
<LINE>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to me:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Cock crows</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If thou art privy to thy country's fate,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</LINE>
<LINE>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</LINE>
<LINE>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, if it will not stand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis here!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis here!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis gone!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Ghost</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</LINE>
<LINE>To offer it the show of violence;</LINE>
<LINE>For it is, as the air, invulnerable,</LINE>
<LINE>And our vain blows malicious mockery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERNARDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then it started like a guilty thing</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,</LINE>
<LINE>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</LINE>
<LINE>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</LINE>
<LINE>The extravagant and erring spirit hies</LINE>
<LINE>To his confine: and of the truth herein</LINE>
<LINE>This present object made probation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</LINE>
<LINE>Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</LINE>
<LINE>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</LINE>
<LINE>And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;</LINE>
<LINE>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</LINE>
<LINE>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</LINE>
<LINE>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORATIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</LINE>
<LINE>But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,</LINE>
<LINE>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:</LINE>
<LINE>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,</LINE>
<LINE>Let us impart what we have seen to-night</LINE>
<LINE>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,</LINE>
<LINE>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</LINE>
<LINE>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know</LINE>
<LINE>Where we shall find him most conveniently.</LINE>
